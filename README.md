# Banyan Security demo for AWS environments using Terraform

## Prerequisities

To run this demo, you will need the following:

1. AWS account with credentials, and an EC2 key-pair
2. Terraform CLI 0.14.9+, configured for AWS provisioning
3. Banyan account and admin API key, and a device with the Banyan Desktop App installed

For instructions on how to set these up, go to the [Prerequisities Details section](#prerequisities-details).

## Run it

Clone this repo to your machine. Edit the `locals.tf` file with details from your environment.

```tf
locals {
  name_prefix = "bnn-demo"

  region = "us-east-1"
  ssh_key_name = "YOUR_AWS_KEY_NAME"

  banyan_host = "https://team.console.banyanops.com/"
  banyan_api_key = "YOUR_BANYAN_API_KEY"
  banyan_org = "YOUR_BANYAN_ORG"
}
```

Then, provision all the resources:

```bash
terraform apply
```

Provisioning is broken up into 6 steps. You can run just a specific step by specifying during the apply as: `terraform apply -target=module.network`

1. **Network** - a new VPC with subnets
2. **Database** - an RDS instance
3. **Application** - an EC2 instance that runs a demo website container
4. **Banyan Connector** - deploy an EC2 instance with the `connector` to create an outbound connection to the Banyan Global Edge network, so you can manage access to your AWS environment
5. **Banyan Policies** - create a few roles and policies to establish which users and devices can access your AWS environment
6. **Banyan Services** - publish the services that are deployed in your AWS environment for your end users

This first 3 steps get you a basic but representative AWS environment. The last 3 steps set up Banyan to provide secure remote access to this environment.


## Access your AWS resources

To access your AWS resources, open the Banyan App and check your services list. Click on a given service to connect to it.

## Prerequisities Details

### AWS

This demo requires an AWS account. If you don't already have an AWS account, you can create a [free AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).

Then, you need to download AWS credentials that will allow you automate infra provisioning. You can create a new Access Key via the [IAM section of the AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/security_credentials).

Check that your AWS account and credentials are set up correctly by installing the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html). [Configure the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) from your terminal to use your credentials.

Finally, you need an EC2 key-pair that you will use if you need to SSH into the instances. If you donâ€™t have a EC2 key-pair, you can [create a key-pair via the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-services-ec2-keypairs.html#creating-a-key-pair).


### Terraform

This demo uses Terraform. Follow the [getting started in AWS tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli?in=terraform/aws-get-started) to install the Terraform CLI (v0.14.9+), learn the basics of Terraform and configure authentication for AWS.


### Banyan

This demo shows you to how to use Banyan Security Zero Trust Remote Access. If you don't have a Banyan account, sign up for a [free Banyan account](https://www.banyansecurity.io/team-edition-signup/).

Take note of your Org name. Navigate to the API Keys section in the Banyan Command Center console and [create an admin API key](https://docs.banyansecurity.io/docs/banyan-components/command-center/api-keys/). Also, [install the Banyan Desktop App on your device](https://support.banyanops.com/support/solutions/folders/44000931532).
